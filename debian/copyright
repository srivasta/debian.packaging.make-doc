Comment: This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of GNU Make.  GNU Make
         was written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath. This package was put
         together by Ian Murdock <imurdock@debian.org>
         Changes:
           * added Debian GNU/Linux package maintenance system files
           * Pared down the package to just the documentation bits, and some
             build infrastructure.
         Parts of the GNU Make build structure remain in this package.

Comment:
 The documentation is released under the GNU Free Documentation License
 (GFDL) and it has a front-cover text: as such, it has been determined
 not to meet the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG), so it is not
 shipped in the Debian packages. Since the source tarball has to be
 repacked, the opportunity is taken to drop off some substantial weight
 by wipping out unnecessary material and by cleaning up regenerated
 material.
